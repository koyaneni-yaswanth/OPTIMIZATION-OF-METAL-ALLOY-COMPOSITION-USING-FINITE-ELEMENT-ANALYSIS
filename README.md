# OPTIMIZATION-OF-METAL-ALLOY-COMPOSITION-USING-FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS


Alloys are the backbone of modern engineering applications, and optimizing their properties is critical for achieving enhanced 
performance in industrial use. This project focuses on using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in ANSYS to study and optimize the 
mechanical behaviour of a selected alloy under various operational conditions. The study includes evaluating stress, strain, 
deformation, and thermal stability to identify weak points and improve performance. This simulation-driven approach significantly 
reduces the time and cost associated with experimental trials, paving the way for designing advanced alloys tailored to specific 
requirements.
